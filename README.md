Clone the repository into any directory using the following command:

$ cd brainfast/
$ cargo build --release
```

##### TODO: Set PATH 
For now, you have to manually set the PATH variable so `brainfast` can be used outside of the 
project directory. If you are working on a Unix-like OS, follow these commands once you are in the root 
directory for the repository:
```
// List PATH values
$ echo $PATH | tr \: \\n
// Copy binary to a PATH value
$ cp ./target/release/brainfast <PATH>
```
Or, if you like, you can set your own PATH and create new folders. 

## Usage
```
$ brainfast -h
It's a Brainf*ck to C compiler!!!

## Download
Clone the repository into any directory using the following command:
```
$ git clone
```

##### TODO: Set PATH 
For now, you have to manually set the PATH variable so `brainfast` can be used outside of the 
project directory. If you are working on a Unix-like OS, follow these commands once you are in the root 
directory for the repository:
```
$ cp ./target/release/brainfast /usr/local/bin/
```
Or, if you like, you can set your own PATH and create new folders.
